        <h5 className='font-bold'>Legal basis of processing</h5>{' '}
        <p>
          The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
          following applies:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul className='list-disc'>
          <li>
            Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
            Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
            Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
            without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
            legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing
            of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
          </li>
          <li>
            provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
            with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which the Owner is subject;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
            Owner;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
            pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
          basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
          provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
          or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 className='font-bold'>Place</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Data is processed at the Owner&apos;s operating offices and in any
          other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Depending on the User&apos;s location, data transfers may involve
          transferring the User&apos;s Data to a country other than their own.
          To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
          Data, Users can check the section containing details about the

          transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
          international organization governed by public international law or set
          up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security
          measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking

          <li>
            Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate

        <br />
        <p>
          The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
          whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
          such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
          to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
          for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an
          authority.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after expiration of the retention period.
